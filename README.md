## What is the ENT Stack?

The ENT Stack is a robust, full-stack monorepo that integrates **Express**, **Next.js**, and **TRPC**, offering a streamlined solution for web app development.

It allows you to build and share code between frontend and backend in a single project while maintaining the flexibility to host them independently.
