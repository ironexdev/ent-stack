## What is the ENT Stack?

The ENT Stack is a robust, full-stack monorepo starter kit that integrates <ins>**E**</ins>xpress 5, <ins>**N**</ins>ext.js 15, and <ins>**T**</ins>RPC, offering a streamlined solution for web app development.

It allows you to build and **share code** between frontend and backend in a single project while maintaining the flexibility to **host them separately**.

## Features

üåÄ **PNPM Workspace - Monorepo**

- The stack uses <a href="https://pnpm.io" target="_blank">PNPM</a> Workspace because it's simple and painless to use. With its efficient dependency management and shared package architecture, <a href="https://pnpm.io" target="_blank">PNPM</a> ensures faster installs and a clean, modular workflow.
- Within the monorepo, each top-level folder plays a distinct role:
  - **apps** folder contains both the backend (`apps/backend`) and frontend (`apps/frontend`) codebases.
  - **packages** folder contains a `shared` directory (`packages/shared`) that centralizes common configurations, utilities, services type definitions, and translations.
- To maintain uniform code quality, each of these directories includes an `eslint.config.js` file featuring consistent rules. A root-level `tsconfig.json` provides a base set of TypeScript configurations, while each subproject extends these defaults to meet its own requirements.

ü§ù **Type-Safe API Layer**

- The stack leverages <a href="https://trpc.io" target="_blank">TRPC</a> to create a type-safe bridge between the frontend and backend. This ensures that your IDE automatically provides type hints and autocompletion for API endpoints, eliminating the need for manual type definitions.

üåê **Translations and Routing (i18n)** 
  
  - A custom, lightweight solution handles localization using standalone functions that use <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages" target="_blank">ICU message syntax</a>.
  - Translation functions can be used anywhere in the stack (both backend and frontend).
  - The stack includes two scripts for message import and export.
  - Frontend routes are fully translatable, defined in standalone .ts file, and dynamically evaluated at runtime through <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a> middleware.

üîí **Authentication & Authorization**

- The stack provides passwordless registration and login through short verification PINs, secure JWT access tokens, and UUID-based refresh tokens. Additionally, frontend routes can be marked as protected in `routes.ts`, restricting them to authenticated users - this is evaluated in `middleware.ts`.

‚öôÔ∏è **Environment & Configuration**

- Leverages <a href="https://env.t3.gg" target="_blank">T3 Env</a> type-safe environment variables validation in both backend and frontend
- Contains Shared configuration file `shared-config.ts` that is extended by both Backend `backend-config.ts` and Frontend `frontend-config.ts` files for feature-focused settings

ü™µ **Logging**

- The stack employs <a href="https://getpino.io" target="_blank">Pino</a> for lightweight and efficient logging across both backend and frontend. Its simple API and minimal overhead ensure clear, structured logs without impacting performance. 

ü™≤ **Error Handling and Validation**

- The stack uses <a href="https://zod.dev" target="_blank">Zod</a> for consistent input validation across the frontend and backend, integrated with <a href="https://trpc.io" target="_blank">TRPC</a> for type-safe error management.
- Input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- Errors are categorized into client, server, and userland types for precise handling.
- <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview" target="_blank">Tanstack Query</a> handles errors through a custom handler with callbacks for server, client, and userland errors.

üîÑ **State Management**

- Uses <a href="https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs" target="_blank">Zustand</a> for lightweight, synchronous global state management, delivering a minimal overhead approach for storing and controlling shared data across the application.
- Uses <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest" target="_blank">Tanstack Query</a> for asynchronous data fetching and caching, providing an SSR-friendly solution that keeps the UI and server in sync.

üõ¢Ô∏è **Database**

- The backend uses <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/" target="_blank">Drizzle ORM</a> for interacting with a <a href="https://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database, providing a type-safe and developer-friendly API.
- It also contains <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/#option-types" target="_blank">Docker</a> Image and a script `bin/docker/run-local-db.sh` to run the database locally.

‚úâÔ∏è **Email Sending**

- integrates <a href="https://resend.com" target="_blank">Resend</a> for developer friendly e-mail sending.
- Backend also contains email test router for email previews and testing.
- Email templates are written in <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com" target="_blank">Handlebars</a>.

ü§ñ **Testing**

- The stack uses <a href="https://playwright.dev" target="_blank">Playwright</a> for unified frontend and backend testing, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- <a href="https://malslurp.dev" target="_blank">Mailslurp</a> is used for comprehensive email testing, verifying email workflows and content.

## Getting Started

Get up and running with the <a href="https://ironexdev.github.io/ent-stack-documentation" target="_blank">ENT Stack</a> in just two steps:

**Prerequisites**
<small>
- <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
- <a href="https://pnpm.io" target="_blank">PNPM</a>
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/#option-types" target="_blank">Docker CLI</a> (for local MySQL database)
- A Unix-like shell environment (e.g., Bash, Zsh)
</small>

### 1/ üöÄ Create your project

```bash
pnpm create ent-stack@latest
```
- Creates a new project (folder) based on specific version of this repository.
- The version used is specified in the description of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-ent-stack" target="_blank">npm package</a>.

### 2/ üî• Setup

```bash
pnpm fire
```
- Installs dependencies
- Starts the local database in a Docker container
- Creates the database and tables
- Runs dev environments for both the backend and frontend

### Environment Variables

If you ran create and setup scripts, then your application should be running just fine, but email sending and testing won't work until adjust env variables listed below:
- To enable email sending, you need to **[sign up for a Resend account](https://resend.com/signup)** and set **RESEND_API_KEY**
- To enable email testing, you need to **[sign up for a Mailslurp account](https://app.mailslurp.com/sign-up)** and set **MAILSLURP_API_KEY**, **MAILSLURP_INBOX_ID** and **MAILSLURP_EMAIL**

Here is the list of values that **MUST BE THE SAME** in both backend and frontend **.env** files:

| Backend       | Frontend                  |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| SITE_NAME     | NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME     |
| COOKIE_DOMAIN | NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_DOMAIN |
| BACKEND_URL   | NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL   |
| FRONTEND_URL  | NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL  |
| JWT_SECRET    | JWT_SECRET                |

**Note:** SERVICE_EMAIL and SECURITY_EMAIL don't need real domains (they are only used in translations).

At this point, your application should be up and running locally. Adjust values, domains, and environment settings as needed.

## Troubleshooting

**MySQL container name conflict**
- `docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/mysql" is already in use by container`
- Remove the existing container by running `docker rm mysql`
  - Or for more nuclear solution, run `bin/docker/cleanup.sh` - this script forcefully cleans up Docker by removing all build caches, containers, images, and unused networks to free disk space and reset the environment.
