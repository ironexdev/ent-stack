- Upgrade to React 19 when Expo supports it
- Adjust TRPC client for the mobile app
- Figure out how to handle html in translations across frontend and mobile apps
  - A/ Tailwind -> NativeWind, use react-native-render
  - B/ Use custom syntax for html/native styling
- TS ESM metro.config https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/916
- Babel config ts is probably possible, but not worth the extra step/s
- Ignore expo-env.d.ts (?)
